# Caesar Cipher Encryption & Decryption

This Python program implements the classic **Caesar cipher** technique for encrypting and decrypting messages by shifting letters by a user-specified key.

## Features

- Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters, preserving case.
- Non-alphabetic characters (spaces, punctuation) remain unchanged.
- Symmetric encryption: the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.
- Beginner-friendly and easy to understand.

## Usage

1. Run the Python script.
2. Enter the message you want to encrypt.
3. Enter the key (an integer) for the cipher shift.
4. The program outputs the encrypted message.
5. Then it decrypts the encrypted message back to the original text.

## Example

Enter the message to : Data is the new oil.
Enter the key: 10
Encrypted message : Nkdk sc dro xog ysv.
decrypted message : Data is the new oil.
